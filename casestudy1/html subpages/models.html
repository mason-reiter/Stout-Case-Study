        <h2>Feature Set</h2>
            <p style="width:750px;">For the feature set that I used, there were a few considerations to make as noted in the <a href="graphs.html">Visualizations</a> section.
                Some variables, like paid_total, provided information that someone trying to determine an interest rate wouldn't have.  Others, like sub_grade, were
                too close to just outright stating the interest rate.  Still others, like current_accounts_delinq, provided so little information that including
                them would pointlessly bloat the machine learning algorithm.  Finally, many variables needed to make small changes to their data in order to properly
                fit in a feature set.</p>
            <p>Here's a list of changes made from the original data set to the feature set:</p>
            <ul class="nav", style="width: 750px">
                <li><b>Removed from set:</b> installment, grade, sub_grade, issue_month, loan_status, initial_listing_status, disbursement_method,
                    balance, paid_total, paid_principal, paid_interest, paid_late_fees</li>
                <li><b>Removed for having too little information:</b> current_accounts_delinq, num_accounts_30d_past_due</li>
                <li><b>Changed to integer values:</b> emp_title, state, homeownership, verified_income, verification_income_joint, loan_purpose, application_type</li>
                <li><b>Changed NA/blank spaces to appropriate values:</b>emp_title, verification_income_joint, emp_length, annual_income, annual_income_joint, debt_to_income_joint, months_since_last_delinq,
                    months_since_90d_late, months_since_last_credit_inquiry, num_accounts_120d_past_due</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
            <p style="width:750px;">For the first algorithm, I decided to use the relatively simple linear regression algorithm.  Since every input variable and the output
                in my feature set was a number, a linear regression made some sense.  It may lack the "intelligence" of a more advanced learning algorithm, but the low
                amount of processing power required to generate and use the regression could potentially offset the algorithm's relative lack of precision.</p>
            <p style="width:750px;">For the second algorithm, I decided to use a neural network with 2 hidden layers.  One of the downsides of a
                linear regression in this case is that many variables aren't particularly well defined by linear relationships.  In addition, the importance of many variables
                strongly depends on others.  Take income_joint and application_type, for example - if the loan applicant isn't taking a joint loan, their joint income should
                play little to no role in their final interest rate.  With a neural network, I'd be able to remedy these issues more easily than with the linear regression.</p>
