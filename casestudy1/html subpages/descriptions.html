        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="width: 750px">This data set is a description of 10,000 accepted loans from Lending Club from January to March 2018. It includes 55 different variables for each
            loan, including such data as interest rates, credit account histories, and even the applicant's job title.</p>
        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p style="width: 750px">Most of the issues with the dataset are discussed in the feature set section <a href="models.html"><b>here</b></a>, but much
            of the issues with the data set boil down to the frequent use of both blank spaces and NA.  Both serve the same purpose in this data set, so the
            blank spaces should be replaced by NA to make the values easier to work with.  There's also some inconsistencies regarding the use of proper capitalization,
            all uppercase characters, or all lowercase characters.  Aside from that, there are no noticeable issues other than the hypothetical one of
            security since one could potentially use this data to identify a user of Lending Club.</p>
