        <h2>Model Accuracy and Error</h2>
        <h3>Model 1: Linear Regression</h3>
            <p>After running a linear regression algorithm on the model, here's what I got for the coefficients:</p>
            <p style="width: 750px">[ 3.03366837e-05, -1.10408271e-02,  5.02931914e-03,  2.81778107e-01,
                -1.45356305e-06, -5.63404400e-01,  2.75768184e-02, -2.92418292e-06,
                4.30769183e-01,  8.80534996e-02,  4.50868009e-01, -5.28780948e-03,
                3.32207956e-03,  1.71239860e-01, -2.41193145e-02,  6.95146617e-02,
                -1.92515569e-06,  8.43403181e-06,  6.38795564e-01,  5.88824515e-02,
                4.28525781e-04,  4.92720383e-06, -1.08710268e-02,  2.02425699e-01,
                -4.13896185e-03, -1.20926887e-01,  1.23952804e-01, -4.34814358e-05,
                -2.95677315e-02, -9.62905820e-02,  3.06106100e-01, -2.44778563e-01,
                -1.86914667e-02, -1.38695411e-02,  7.27519925e-02, -7.52444099e-02,
                -3.85250789e-01,  1.39209712e-05,  1.67127192e-01]</p>
            <p style="width: 750px">This may not mean much to the average reader, so let me say that the mean squared error for this algorithm was <b>16.60</b>.  This
                means that the average difference between the predicted and actual interest rate was about <b>4.07</b>.  One doesn't need any visualizations to know that
                this isn't a very good prediction model.  With a maximum interest rate of just over 30 percent, this means that the predicted interest rate for any given
                input would be off by 4.07 percentage points on average!  Clearly, linear regression is not the way to go in this scenario.</p>
            <img src="../images/results1.PNG" width="500">
            <p style="width: 750px">As seen in this graph, the linear regression got the basic shape of most variables correct but completely broke down when it came
                to point-to-point accuracy.  Furthermore, data points with larger values tend to have greater differences between actual and predicted interest rates.</p>
        <h3>Model 2: Neural Net</h3>
            <p style="width: 750px">I attempted to make a neural net using my current knowledge in MIT's Machine Learning class, but we've only been doing theoretical
                machine learning algorithms and thus I didn't have time to make one using Numpy.  I sincerely apologize for not having a second algorithm ready.</p>
        <h2>Proposed Enhancements</h2>
            <ul class="nav", style="width: 750px">
                <li>Currently, the machine learning model I used goes through the data without randomizing its order.  If I randomized the order in which I went through
                the data as well as the starting weights, I should be able to improve the accuracy of the model.</li>
                <li>Even though there were 10000 data points, there were still many variables that had little to no useful data.  As a result, perhaps we'd get more
                accurate results if we just added more input data.</li>
                <li>If I had more time (and actually managed to make a functioning neural net), I'd vary the number of nodes and layers in the neural net.
                    There's a delicate balance between having too little data to accurately find weights for everything and not using your data enough, so
                    finding the perfect number of each would definitely make the proposed neural net more accurate.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
            <ul class="nav", style="width: 750px">
                <li><b>These loans were generally representative of all data on Lending Club:</b>  One can see by issue_month alone that these were only drawn
                    from a specific three-month period of time in 2018, after which any number of changes to Lending Club's interest rate formula could have been made.</li>
                <li><b>These loans were representative of all proposed loan offers:</b>  In reality, these are only accepted loans. It could entirely be the case that
                    Lending Club's interest rate formula is out of whack, in which case many offers are ridiculous and just get rejected by the potential borrower.</li>
                <li><b>There are no hidden variables that weren't included in the data set:</b>  If Lending Club has special deals for friends of the company, or the
                    company provides discounts for any reason not disclosed in the data set, there's no way for my models to account for that.</li>
