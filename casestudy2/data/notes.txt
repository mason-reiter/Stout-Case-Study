TODO: create a few more graphs, write short analysis of each one, then upload to Github

all I have to do now is:
-Generate some interesting, unique ;) graphs
-Convert this data to an HTML site
***REMEMBER***
You can stretch and zoom on Matplotlib graphs to make whatever rectagnle-esque shape you want

graph1: x=Net revenue at a given year (rounded to nearest integer), y=Number of people with that net revenue at the given year
        pink = 2015, blue = 2016, green = 2017
        Range and distribution of net revenues seems relatively unchanged, but number of customers at each net revenue increases at the same rate
        No net revenues over 250 for any year seems weird, if I knew what kind of product we were selling I'd try to analyze why nobody's buying more

other graph ideas:
        -Average net revenue of lost/kept/new customers
        -Ratio of lost/kept/new customers per year
        -Does number of consonants in email correlate to anything????
